# Methods

RNA-seq counts were generated by [bcbio-nextgen][] and [bcbioRnaseq][] using [salmon][] [@salmon]. Counts were imported into [R][] using [tximport][] [@tximport] and [DESeq2] [@DESeq2]. Gene annotations were obtained from [Ensembl][]. Plots were generated by [ggplot2][] [@ggplot2]. Heatmaps were generated by [pheatmap][] [@pheatmap].

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
